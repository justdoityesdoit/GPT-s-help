"switch" statement in a simple way!

The "switch" statement is a type of control flow statement that allows you 
to execute different code blocks based on the value of a variable or expression.

Here's an example:


let fruit = "apple";

switch (fruit) {
  case "banana":
    console.log("This is a banana.");
    break;
  case "apple":
    console.log("This is an apple.");
    break;
  case "orange":
    console.log("This is an orange.");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("I don't know what fruit this is.");
}
In this example, we have a variable called "fruit" that is assigned the value "apple". 
The switch statement then evaluates the value of "fruit" and executes the code block 
that matches the corresponding "case" statement. In this case, since the value of 
"fruit" is "apple", the code block associated with the "case" statement for "apple" will be executed, 
which is to log the message "This is an apple." to the console.

The "default" case is executed if none of the "case" statements match the value of 
the variable being evaluated.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.









const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

// Using a for loop to iterate through the array
for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  console.log(numbers[i]);
}

// Using a for...of loop to iterate through the array
for (let number of numbers) {
  console.log(number);
}

// Using a forEach loop to iterate through the array
numbers.forEach(function(number) {
  console.log(number);
});

// Using a while loop to iterate through the array
let i = 0;
while (i < numbers.length) {
  console.log(numbers[i]);
  i++;
}

// Using a do...while loop to iterate through the array
let j = 0;
do {
  console.log(numbers[j]);
  j++;
} while (j < numbers.length);

// Using a for...in loop to loop through the object keys
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  gender: "male"
};
for (let key in person) {
  console.log(key + ": " + person[key]);
}


In this example, we have an array called numbers that contains the values 1 through 6. 
We use a for loop, a for...of loop, a forEach loop, a while loop, and a do...while loop 
to iterate through the array and log each number to the console.

We also use a for...in loop to loop through the keys of an object called person and log 
each key-value pair to the console.

By practicing with different types of loops, you can become more comfortable with using 
them in your own code.

Here's an example of a HTML DOM code that you can use to practice JavaScript:


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>DOM Example</title>
  <script>
    function changeText() {
      const heading = document.querySelector('h1');
      heading.innerText = 'New Heading';
    }

    function toggleImage() {
      const image = document.querySelector('img');
      if (image.style.display === 'none') {
        image.style.display = 'block';
      } else {
        image.style.display = 'none';
      }
    }
  </script>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Heading</h1>
  <p>Click the button to change the heading text.</p>
  <button onclick="changeText()">Click me</button>
  <p>Click the button to toggle the image.</p>
  <button onclick="toggleImage()">Click me</button>
  <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150" alt="Placeholder image" style="display: block;">
</body>
</html>


In this example, we have an HTML document that includes two buttons
, a h1 element, a p element, and an img element.

The first button has an onclick attribute that specifies a JavaScript function 
called changeText(). When the button is clicked, the function selects the 
h1 element using querySelector and changes its text content using innerText.

The second button also has an onclick attribute that specifies a 
JavaScript function called toggleImage(). When the button is clicked, 
the function selects the img element using querySelector and toggles 
its visibility using the style.display property.

By practicing with HTML DOM code like this, you can learn how to manipulate HTML elements on the page using JavaScript.
